\section{Socket object}
\paragraph{Overview}
The socket object keeps track of the state of the network sockets on both the client and server side. It also maintains the TCP state machine and the mapped ports, as well as the associated \texttt{FileObject} file descriptor.

\paragraph{Port mapping}
Ports are mapped to sockets for both incoming and outgoing connections.

\subsection{TCP state machine}

The socket object contains a TCP state machine implementing the seven TCP states and the transitions between them, which occur based on syscalls, timer events or the receipt of TCP-flagged packets, such as \texttt{ACK} or \texttt{STP}.

\section{Networking syscalls}
\subsection{connect()}

\paragraph{Overview}
The \texttt{connect()} syscall takes as arguments the host address and the port to which a connection will be opened. It begins by disabling interrupts and creating a new socket object s, which is assigned a valid, free port in the range (0,127). Next, the \texttt{state} member is set to \texttt{SYN\_SENT} and a \texttt{SYN} packet is sent out on the connection. 

At this point, the socket blocks its handler thread until it receives a SYN/ACK interrupt from the network layer. Alternatively, a timeout from the alarm clock can break the code (how?). Once the \texttt{SYN/ACK} has arrived, \texttt{s.state} is set to \texttt{ESTABLISHED} and interrupts are re-enabled. At this point, the connection has been successfully opened and the function returns the integer value of socket's associated file descriptor. \\






\noindent Pseudocode:

\begin{lstlisting}
int connect(host, port){
	disable interrupts
	create a new socket s and assign it to a free port in (0,127)
	s.state = SYN_SENT
	send SYN packet
	block until SYN/ACK recv'd // timeout breaks this
	s.state = ESTABLISHED
	enable interrupts
	return s.fileDescriptor
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{accept()}
\paragraph{Overview}
The \texttt{accept()} syscall takes as arguments a port on which to accept a connection. It begins by disabling interrupts and checking for a waiting connection on the supplied port. If there is a waiting connection, a new \texttt{socket} object is created and assigned to that port. Otherwise, -1 is immediately returned.

Next, the TCP state of the socket is set to \texttt{ESTABLISHED} and a \texttt{SYN/ACK} packet is sent out. Interrupts are re-enabled and the method returns the socket's associated file descriptor.\\

\noindent Pseudocode:

\begin{lstlisting}
int acccept(port){
	disable interrupts
	if there are connections waiting on port
		create a new socket s, assign it that port
	else return -1
	s.state = ESTABLISHED
	send SYN/ACK
	enable interrupts
	return s.fileDescriptor
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{write()}
\paragraph{Overview}
The \texttt{write()} syscall extends the implementation from phase 2 with special handling for sockets. It attempts to write the supplied number of bytes from the supplied buffer into the specified socket, returning -1 on failure. It succeeds if the connection is already established and the write (outgoing) buffer has room for the entire message.
\begin{lstlisting}
int write(fileDescriptor, buffer, count){
	...
	if (s.state == ESTABLISHED && s.writeBuffer.bytesFree() <= count)
		write to outgoing buffer
		//post office handles packet creation
		
	...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{read()}

\section{Sliding window}

\paragraph{Overview}
The \texttt{read()} syscall extends the implementation from phase 2 for the case in which it encounters a \texttt{socket} object. As in the previous implementation, \texttt{read()} takes as input the file descriptor, a buffer into which to place the read data and a number of bytes of data to read.

If the socket is open, \texttt{read()} will read up to the number of requested bytes, assuming that there are that many in the buffer. If there are fewer than requested then the entire buffer is retrieved and the number of bytes read is returned.

If the socket is closed and still has data, then read will work in the same way as before, with the difference that it will delete the socket. 

\begin{lstlisting}
int read(fileDescriptor, buffer, count){
	...
	// for a socket
	if (s.isOpen){
		read count bytes
		return bytes successfully read
	} else {
		if (socket isn't empty){
			read count bytes
			if (socket is empty)
				delete socket
			return bytes successfully read	
		}	
	}
}


\end{lstlisting}
\section{Threads}
\paragraph{Overview}
There are three primary threads responsible for the handling of network communication, \texttt{send}, \texttt{receive} and \texttt{timeout}.

\subsection{Send thread}
This \texttt{send} thread iterates through all of the existing socket's outgoing buffers and sends the data out as expected.

\begin{lstlisting}
sendPacket()
{
        socketLock.acquire
        unacknowledgedPackets.add
        NetKernel.packetManager.addMessage
        socketLock.release
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Receive thread}
The \texttt{receive} thread iterates through all of the existing socket's incoming buffers and passes the data up.
\begin{lstlisting}
public void recievePacket (int port)
{
	Lib.asserttrue(port>=0 && box<port < queue.length)
	MailMessage mail = queue[port].removeFirst();
	If(Lib.test(dbgNet))
	// got mail on the port
	Return mail
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Timeout thread}
This thread works like waitUntil, where it loops through the existing sockets and checks for any that have lived past their timeout value. If they have, it closes that socket.
\begin{lstlisting}
timeOutEvent()
{
	switch(state)
	{
	case SYN_SENT:
	sendSYN
	break
	case ESTABLISHED:
	case STOP_SENT:
	socketLock.acquire
	for(Packet p: unacknowledgedPackets)
	{
	NetKernel.packetManager.addMessage
	}
	socketLock.release
	break;
	case CLOSING:
	sendFIN
	break
	}
}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Chat}
\subsection{Client}
\paragraph{Overview} The chat client maintains three buffers, \texttt{outgoingMessage}, \\ \texttt{incomingMessage} and \texttt{temp} and has a socket connection to the server on (server-incoming) port 15. Each of the buffers has size equal to the predefined maximum character count for a line.

\texttt{outgoingMessage} is used to store and buffer user-typed messages, \\ \texttt{incomingMessage} buffers messages from the server and \texttt{temp} is used as a swap buffer.

The client itself runs in an indefinite loop, until it receives a '.' character as input, at which point it closes its socket connection and returns exit code 0 for success. 

In each loop iteration, the client first reads pending user input into \\ \texttt{outgoingMessage}, copying it past any existing data in the buffer. It then checks that there is user input to be handled, and if there is, loops through \texttt{outgoingMessage}, copying data up the newline character into \texttt{temp} and moving the remaining data to the beginning of the buffer. \texttt{temp} is then written to the socket. This continues until there are no more newline characters in \texttt{outgoingMessage}. 

If there is no user input pending, then the client performs a \texttt{read} operation on the socket, filling \texttt{incomingMessage} with data starting from the end of the existing data, up to the end of the buffer. After the read completes, the client loops through \texttt{incomingMessage}, copying data into \texttt{temp} up to each \textbackslash n character, moving the data in \texttt{incomingMessage} to the beginning of the buffer and printing the contents of \texttt{temp} to the screen. \\

\noindent Pseudocode:

\begin{lstlisting}
int main(serverAddress){
		
}
\end{lstlisting}
