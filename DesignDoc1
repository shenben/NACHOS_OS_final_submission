(5%, 5 lines) Implement KThread.join(). 
Note that another thread does not have to call join(), but if it is called, it must be called only once. 
The result of calling join() a second time on the same thread is undefined, even if the second caller is a different thread than the first caller.
A thread must finish executing normally whether or not it is joined.
