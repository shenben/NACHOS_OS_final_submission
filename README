I copied the contents of this readme to the Wiki. It's on the left side menu, 3rd button from the bottom on Bitbucket.
The Wiki give us Markdown syntax (kind of like HTML), which will be more manageable when this file gets big/complicated.

Syntax guide available here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
